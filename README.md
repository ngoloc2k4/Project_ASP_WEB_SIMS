# Step 2: System Design

In this step, we will create a detailed design for the Student Information Management System (SIMS), including the architecture, class diagrams, database schema, and user interface design.

#### 2.1 Architecture Design

- **Layered Architecture:**

  - **Presentation Layer:** Handles the user interface and user interaction.
  - **Business Logic Layer:** Contains the core functionality and business rules.
  - **Data Access Layer:** Manages communication with the database.
  - **Database:** Stores all the persistent data.

- **Key Design Patterns:**

  - **Model-View-Controller (MVC):**
    - **Model:** Represents the data and business logic.
    - **View:** The user interface, which displays data and interacts with the user.
    - **Controller:** Handles user input and updates the Model and View.
  - **Repository Pattern:**
    - Encapsulates the logic for data access, making it easier to switch data sources or perform testing.
  - **Singleton Pattern:**
    - Ensures that certain classes (like logging services or configuration managers) have only one instance throughout the application.

- **Component Diagram:**
  - **User Interface (UI):** Interacts with students, faculty, and administrators.
  - **Authentication Module:** Handles user login, registration, and role management.
  - **Course Management Module:** Manages course creation, assignment, and enrollment.
  - **Student Management Module:** Manages student registration, profiles, and academic records.
  - **Database Layer:** Stores user data, course details, enrollment records, etc.
